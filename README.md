#  UniBW Agentic AI Bootcamp
![alt text](instructors.png)

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Bootcamp**!
The **Agentic AI Bootcamp** is a hands-on, modular learning experience designed by **IBM Client Engineering** for Clients and Business Partners.
The goal is that you gain hands-on experience with our agentic AI platform watsonx. 

## Prerequisites

We have the following prerequisites to participate in the bootcamp:
- A GitHub account to access this repository
- An IBM ID so that we can give you access to an IBM cloud environment so that you can work with our platform on the use cases. You can create one at https://cloud.ibm.com/.
- Refer to the [Setup](environment-setup/README.md) to be sure to complete the required setup steps and that you accept the invitation for the cloud account, which include
  - creating an API key
  - creating a Project in Watsonx
  - creating a Deployment Space in watsonx runtime.
 
## Use Cases 
We will cover at least one use case and depending on the time and your pace, you might even work on two use cases:
1. `business automation`: This is the easier use case to start with so that you get familiar how to build an agent. You find the information for this use case in the [business-automation](business-automation/hands-on-lab-business-automation.md)
2. `intelligent assistant`: In this more advanced use case you will build an intelligent assistant that is based on a multi-agent systemt. That means you will use multiple agents to solve specific tasks. You find the information for this use case in the [intelligent assistant folder](intelligent%20assistant/Intelligent%20AI%20Assistant.md).


# Whats Next: More Hands-on on Agentic AI with Langflow

If we sparkled your interest in Agentic AI and you want to play around further with it, then this might also be interesting for you.

IBM recently acquired DataStax and with it, the [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/) tool - an open source low/no-code tool to develop agentic AI systems.
In the following GitHub repository you can find an example how to build an agent in Langflow: https://github.com/difli/watsonx-langflow-agent?tab=readme-ov-file.

You can try out this use case on your own, the only requirement is to have a GitHub account. 
If you want to deploy your created agent afterwards in orchestrate, you can signup for a 30 days trial and add it via MCP Server. 
Of course, you then also have 30-days to play around with watsonx and orchestrate as well!
