#  UniBW Agentic AI Bootcamp
![alt text](instructors.png)

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Bootcamp**!
The **Agentic AI Bootcamp** is a hands-on, modular learning experience designed by **IBM Client Engineering** for Clients and Business Partners.
The goal is that you gain hands-on experience with our agentic AI platform watsonx. 

## Use Cases 
We will cover at least one use case and depending on the time and your pace, you might even work on two use cases:
1. `business automation`: This is the easier use case to start with so that you get familiar how to build an agent. You find the information for this use case in the [business-automation](business-automation/hands-on-lab-business-automation.md)
2. `intelligent assistant`: In this more advanced use case you will build an intelligent assistant that is based on a multi-agent systemt. That means you will use multiple agents to solve specific tasks. You find the information for this use case in the [intelligent assistant folder](intelligent%20assistant/Intelligent%20AI%20Assistant.md).

## Prerequisites

We have the following prerequisites to complete the bootcamp:
- A GitHub account to access this repository
- An IBM ID so that we can give you access to an IBM cloud environment so that you can work with our platform on the use cases. You can create one at https://cloud.ibm.com/.
- Refer to the [Setup](environment-setup/readme.md) to be sure to complete the required setup steps and that you accept the invitation for the cloud account, which include
  - creating an API key
  - creating a Project in Watsonx
  - creating a Deployment Space in watsonx runtime.
